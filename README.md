# General Overview and Objective

This repository visualizes the result of PISA School Survey, specifically focusing on the part where school principals are asked whether or not the school's capacity to provide instruction is hindered by a lack of critical resources.
We are going to look at the comparison of the answer between several countries: Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, Thailand, and Vietnam. This analysis is important in that it can be one of the first steps to understand where the challenge of education service delivery lies, and at which part improvement becomes crucial.

Furthermore, we are also going to look at how the pain point in education service delivery in terms of lack of critical resources correlates with the mean of PISA math score.
